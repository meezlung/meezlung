### Hello World, I am Gabriel Mislang ✨

I'm an incoming student at the University of the Philippines with a degree in Computer Science. I'm a Mr. Robot fan who's passionate about collecting and solving Rubik's cubes, fiddling with Linux, making websites (we used to make calculators and school websites in MakSci), and tackling CTF challenges on picoCTF (you can check out my documentation repository). In my free time, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge. I tend to hyperfocus on topics, often delving deep into programming and seeking a comprehensive understanding of various computer science fields. This pursuit helps me become a better programmer.
