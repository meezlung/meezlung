## Hello World, I am Gabriel Mislang âœ¨

I'm an incoming student at the University of the Philippines with a degree in Computer Science. 

I'm a big **Mr. Robot fan** who's passionate about collecting and **solving Rubik's cubes**, fiddling with **Linux** (Kali and Ubuntu), making **websites** from scratch (we used to make calculators and school websites in MakSci), and tackling CTF challenges on **picoCTF** (you can check out my documentation repository). 

In my free time, I'm **always eager to expand my knowledge**. I tend to hyperfocus on topics, often delving deep into **programming** and seeking a comprehensive understanding of various **computer science fields**. This pursuit helps me become a **better programmer**.
