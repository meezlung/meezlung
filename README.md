### Hello World, I am Gabriel Mislang

I'm an incoming student at the University of the Philippines with a degree in Computer Science. I'm passionate about collecting and solving Rubik's cubes, and tackling CTF challenges on picoCTF (you can check my documentation repository for more). In my free time, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge. I tend to hyperfocus on topics, often delving deep into programming and seeking a comprehensive understanding of various computer science fields. This pursuit helps me become a better programmer.
